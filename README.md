# MAGIC-Telescope
An in-depth machine learning analysis of the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset using various algorithms including kNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks to understand and predict gamma ray patterns.

# Project Description
The MAGIC Telescope project is a comprehensive analysis and machine learning exploration using the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project aims to apply various machine learning models to the dataset to identify patterns and make predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Bock, R. (2007), titled "MAGIC Gamma Telescope", and is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C52C8B. The dataset is vital for understanding gamma rays using the MAGIC telescope observations.

# Models and Analysis
Train, Validation, Test datasets: The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the machine learning models.
<u> kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)</u> : Implements the kNN algorithm to classify data points based on their similarity.
<u> Naive Bayes </u>: Utilizes the Naive Bayes classifier for probabilistic predictions.
<u> Logistic Regression </u>: Applies logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
<u> SVM (Support Vector Machine) </u>: Employs SVM for identifying decision boundaries in complex datasets.
<u> Neural Networks </u>: Leverages neural networks to model complex patterns and relationships in the data.

# How to Use
To replicate the analysis and results, follow these steps:
Download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Run each Jupyter Notebook cell in sequence to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
